# Row-Python Machine Learning
Here are the implementation of some Machine Learning algorithms with python and numpy only. (Without any other third party libraries)

# Algorithms 
The following algorithms will be implemented:

✔ Linear Regression with one feature. 

✔ Linear Regression with multiple features.

✔ Logistic Regression for binary classification.

✔ Artificial Neural Network.
