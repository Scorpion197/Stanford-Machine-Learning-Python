# Row-Python Machine Learning
Here are the implementation of some Machine Learning algorithms I've learned on [ Coursera](https://www.coursera.com) with python and numpy only. (Without any other third party libraries)


# Algorithms 
The following algorithms will be implemented:

✔ Linear Regression with one feature ( UniLinear Regression).

✔ Linear Regression with multiple features (MultiLinear Reg).

✔ Artificial Neural Network.
